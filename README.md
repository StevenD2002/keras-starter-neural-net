## Welcome
I followed this tutorial from [machine learning mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/)
# This is just a simple tutorial project for me to learn the basics of Keras:
- create a model based with pre-cleaned data
- evaluate the newly created model
- make new predictions with the model

Thanks for checking me out! 😁
